# VSCode Copilot Code Review Extension

An intelligent VS Code extension that leverages GitHub Copilot to perform automated code reviews on Git commits. Get instant feedback on your code changes with AI-powered analysis covering code quality, security, performance, and best practices.

## Features

✨ **AI-Powered Reviews**: Uses GitHub Copilot to analyze your code changes
🔍 **Comprehensive Analysis**: Covers code quality, security, performance, and maintainability
⚡ **Instant Feedback**: Get reviews in seconds with simple hotkey commands
📝 **Detailed Reports**: Formatted markdown reports with actionable suggestions
🎯 **Flexible Targeting**: Review latest commit or specify any commit hash
⚙️ **Configurable Settings**: Adjust the diff truncation limit to optimize token usage

## Configuration

The extension provides a configurable setting to control the maximum number of characters included in the diff for code reviews. This helps optimize token usage and ensures that reviews remain efficient, even for large commits.

### Setting: `copilotCodeReview.diffTruncationLimit`
- **Description**: Specifies the maximum number of characters to include in the diff sent to GitHub Copilot for review.
- **Default**: 5000 characters
- **How It Works**: The extension truncates the diff to the specified limit before sending it to GitHub Copilot. This ensures that the review remains within token limits while focusing on the most relevant changes.
- **How to Configure**:
  1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac).
  2. Type `Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)` and select it.
  3. Add or update the following setting:
     ```json
     "copilotCodeReview.diffTruncationLimit": 7000
     ```
  4. Save the file.

## Usage

### Ideal Number of Commits for Review
When reviewing multiple commits, it is recommended to limit the number of commits to **5 or fewer** at a time. This ensures that:
- The review process remains efficient and does not exceed token limits.
- Each commit receives adequate attention during the review.

If you need to review more than 5 commits, consider splitting them into smaller batches for better results.

### Review Latest Commit
- **Command**: `Review Latest Commit with Copilot`
- **Hotkey**: `Ctrl+Alt+J` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Alt+J` (Mac)
- **Action**: Reviews the most recent commit in your repository

### Review Specific Commit
- **Command**: `Review Specific Commit with Copilot`
- **Hotkey**: `Ctrl+Alt+K` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Alt+K` (Mac)
- **Action**: Prompts for a commit hash and reviews that specific commit

### Using the Commands

1. Open a Git repository in VS Code
2. Use the hotkeys or run commands from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
3. Wait for the AI analysis to complete
4. Review the results in the generated markdown document

## What Gets Analyzed

The extension analyzes your commits for:

- **Code Quality**: Best practices, coding standards, and maintainability
- **Potential Bugs**: Logic errors, edge cases, and runtime issues
- **Security**: Vulnerabilities, unsafe operations, and security best practices
- **Performance**: Inefficient algorithms, memory usage, and optimization opportunities
- **Testing**: Missing tests, test coverage recommendations

## Output Format

Reviews are presented in a structured markdown format including:

- **Overall Rating**: Good, Needs Improvement, or Major Issues
- **Summary**: Brief overview of the changes and assessment
- **Issues Found**: Categorized by severity (Low, Medium, High) and type
- **Suggestions**: Actionable recommendations for improvement
